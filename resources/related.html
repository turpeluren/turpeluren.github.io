            <br>
            <p>I started off by disassembling the original furniture. It consisted of five major red blocks, two of which a bit larger. I 
                tried putting them in different ways and was thinking of a chair at first before the idea of a table struck me. The top was a difficult one to plan, but I knew I wanted some shape to coume out of it. I sketched and cut large paper to get 
                a sense of the shape. ...</p>

            <h4>Documentation of the pheasant-inspired tapestry I made at Nyckelviksskolan around the beginning of 2022.</h4>
            
            <br>
            <p>In my textile art class, we were tasked with creating a tapestry starting from a bird. We were to incorporate the overall look of the bird, 
                its sound as well as a specific spot around the school that we could choose as we liked. I had a hard time choosing a bird as I know nothing 
                about them but I searched around for different birds that I somewhat recognized and listened to their sounds. ...</p>

            <h4>The story of a drawing I made trying to fuck with law-systems.</h4>
            
            <br>
            <p>I wrote down in my notes to make an art piece like a contract. With a signature you would be proclaimed the "rightful"
                owner. Firstly, I signed it myself to claim initial ownership. Then hung it on the wall of our (my two friends and I) 
                apartment in Barcelona. When we had friends over I hoped they would find it interesting but it took a while
                until Bianca signed during a party. I later heard from her that their french neighbor had signed and maybe?
                brought it to France.

            <h4>"Vessel" screen print documentation</h4>
            
            <br>
            <p>My second screen print, which you can still buy at my big cartel shop.
                The image is based on several artbreeder images: this pot, this thing
                which I think looks like a circus tiger & it's keeper, and a last one with two mouths which's url 
                I'm still searching for. 
                The print involves three different screens: the main one, a secondary with the tiger and a third with a line of ceramics.
