        <p>My second screen print, which you can still buy at my big cartel shop.
            The image is based on several artbreeder images: this pot, this thing
            which I think looks like a circus tiger & it's keeper, and a last one with two mouths which's url 
            I'm still searching for. 
            The print involves three different screens: the main one, a secondary with the tiger and a third with a line of ceramics.
