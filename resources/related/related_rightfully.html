        <h4>The story of a drawing I made trying to fuck with law-systems.</h4>
        
        <br>
        <p>I wrote down in my notes to make an art piece like a contract. With a signature you would be proclaimed the "rightful"
            owner. Firstly, I signed it myself to claim initial ownership. Then hung it on the wall of our (my two friends and I) 
            apartment in Barcelona. When we had friends over I hoped they would find it interesting but it took a while
            until Bianca signed during a party. I later heard from her that their french neighbor had signed and maybe?
            brought it to France.
