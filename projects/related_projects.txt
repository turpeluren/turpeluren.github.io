                <br>
                <p>I started off by disassembling the original furniture. It consisted of five major red blocks, two of which a bit larger. I 
                    tried putting them in different ways and was thinking of a chair at first before the idea of a table struck me. The top was a difficult one to plan, but I knew I wanted some shape to coume out of it. I sketched and cut large paper to get 
                    a sense of the shape. ...</p>

                <br>
                <p>In my textile art class, we were tasked with creating a tapestry starting from a bird. We were to incorporate the overall look of the bird, 
                    its sound as well as a specific spot around the school that we could choose as we liked. I had a hard time choosing a bird as I know nothing 
                    about them but I searched around for different birds that I somewhat recognized and listened to their sounds. ...</p>

                <h4>The story of a drawing I made trying to fuck with law-systems.</h4>
                
                <br>
                <p>I wrote down in my notes to make an art piece like a contract. With a signature you would be proclaimed the "rightful"
                    owner. Firstly, I signed it myself to claim initial ownership. Then hung it on the wall of our (my two friends and I) 
                    apartment in Barcelona. When we had friends over I hoped they would find it interesting but it took a while
                    until Bianca signed during a party. I later heard from her that their french neighbor had signed and maybe?
                    brought it to France.
