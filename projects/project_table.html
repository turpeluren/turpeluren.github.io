        <h1>Table from drawer project</h1>

        <h4>Documentation of a table I made at Nyckelviksskolan around the end of 2021.</h4>

        <p class="imgp">Me, a skull & the table</p>

        <h2>The task</h2>
        <p>In the woodworking class we were tasked to buy a second hand piece of furniture and deconstruct it, thereafter perhaps 
        forming it into something new. We could only choose to keep its original finish, scrape it or paint black or white, because 
        the shape should be the thing in focus.</p>

        <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/transformation_full.jpg" alt='Before and after'>
        <p class="imgp">Before and after</p>

        <h2>The build</h2>

        <div class="display">

                <p>I started off by disassembling the original furniture. It consisted of five major red blocks, two of which a bit larger. I 
                tried putting them in different ways and was thinking of a chair at first before the idea of a table struck me.</p>
                <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/drawer_full.JPG" alt='The original drawer'>
                <p>top was a difficult one to plan, but I knew I wanted some shape to coume out of it. I sketched and cut large paper to get 
                a sense of the shape.</p>
                <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/top_cutout_full.JPG" alt='Working on a shape for the top'>

                <p>I began with these blocks to cut out interesting shapes. I am a sucker for detail and can't really help myself. The small weird cuts 
                were originally going to be circles but I cut this much in the band saw and thought it looked cool. After this I cut almost all the 
                pieces with decorative shapes.</p> 
                <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/sides_full.JPG" alt='Support beams for sliding plate'>
                <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/inside_full.jpg" alt='Shapes at the leg-intersection'>
                <p>The legs are structured like and 'H' for stability and the middle wall has a hole for the sliding drawer to go through. I put 
                one extra support beam on each side as the middle wall was not the most stable with the hole and the hole construction was 
                able to wiggle a bit since it was in the middle.</p>
                <img src="../img/portfolio/project_table/table_full.JPG" alt='Finished product'>

                <p>I plugged and glued everything together at the end.</p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately my phone broke somewhere at the end of this project so lost most of the pictures from the process. Overall it was a 
            fun build and felt nice to be back in a woodworking-shop with all the large machines. Used the band saw a lot during my cutting 
            decorative shapes-mania. I'm happy with the table but still has not gotten it home since I don't have a car or anything and 
            it's quite heavy. Would really like to use it as a sitting down dining table. (Or if it hurts to much to sit at the floor - a sofa
            table.)

        <p>Update as of 2022-08-28: The table is sadly lost since I did not pick it up during the entire summer. The school has started again
            for the next year and some friends there reported the table is no longer where it were. I knew it would be thrown away if I didn't pick
            it up but thought I had more time... Well, maybe it was destined. I do not grief.. much.

                <br>
                <p>In my textile art class, we were tasked with creating a tapestry starting from a bird. We were to incorporate the overall look of the bird, 
                    its sound as well as a specific spot around the school that we could choose as we liked. I had a hard time choosing a bird as I know nothing 
                    about them but I searched around for different birds that I somewhat recognized and listened to their sounds. ...</p>

                <br>
                <p>I wrote down in my notes to make an art piece like a contract. With a signature you would be proclaimed the "rightful"
                    owner. Firstly, I signed it myself to claim initial ownership. Then hung it on the wall of our (my two friends and I) 
                    apartment in Barcelona. When we had friends over I hoped they would find it interesting but it took a while
                    until Bianca signed during a party. I later heard from her that their french neighbor had signed and maybe?
                    brought it to France.
